# personal take 
the basic thought process behind creating this project was very simple, this is my first cyber project. before diving deep into the cyber world i wanted to learn the basic mindset of people in the vast field. building the password generator with mutlilingual feature, selecting the language you want and adding the memorable details gives personalization to the user, which makes it more special and interesting to work on and still this project have much more scope of enhancements and i still come across with lots of ideas to be implemented in the future.
